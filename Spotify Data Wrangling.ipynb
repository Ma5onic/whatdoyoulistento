    "\n",
    "**Comments:** This measure has no concern for play count as Spotify does not expose this with their API. I could theoretically have saved a ton of \"indietronica\" music, listened to some of it once, then listenened to the same 4 or 5 'wonky' type songs everyday for the past year and those would not be represented by this measure. However I chose this 'saved' music type of measure because it is in line with how I use Spotify, if it has been saved to a playlist, I probably listen to it quite a bit.\n",

    "**Result: ** As you can see in the table below, my tastes are pretty consistent across these different playlists. I would give the most weight to Top 100 when answering the question 'What do you listen to\" as it takes play count into effect where Recent Saved music could have music I saved but didn't really listen to.\n",
